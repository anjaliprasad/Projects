Bias Variance Trade-off 
Let the function f (x) = 2x2 + ε, where ε is Gaussian noise drawn from N (0, 0.1). We are also given the following functions:
• g1(x)=1
• g2(x)=w0
• g3(x) = w0 + w1x
• g4(x)=w0 +w1x+w2x2
• g5(x)=w0 +w1x+w2x2 +w3x3
• g6(x)=w0 +w1x+w2x2 +w3x3 +w4x4

(a) Randomly generate 100 datasets. Each dataset contains 10 samples (xi , yi ), where xi is uniformly sampled from [−1,1] and yi = f(xi). For a given g function, estimate its parameters using linear regression (with no regularization) and compute the sum-square-error on every dataset. Then plot the histogram of the mean-squared-error. Repeat this for each g function. Please provide the 6 histogram plots in the report. For each g function, estimate its bias2 and variance, and report the results. 
(b) In (a), change the sample size in each dataset to 100, and repeat the procedures. Plot the resulting histograms in the report. For each g function, estimate its bias2 and variance, and report the results. 
(c) Given your results in (a) and (b), discuss how the model complexity and sample size affect the bias2 and variance. 
(d) Consider function hλ(x) = w0 + w1x + w2x2 where λ ≥ 0 is the L2 regularization parameter used during linear regression i.e. your regression loss function will have an additional λ(w02 + w12 +w2) regularization term. Following (b) (i.e. 100 samples per dataset), estimate the bias2 and variance of each hλ(x) when λ is set to 0.001,0.003,0.01,0.03,0.1,0.3,1.0 respectively. Analyze your obtained values and discuss how λ affects the bias2 and variance.
