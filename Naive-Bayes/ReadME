Implemented Naives Bayes algorithm on a given dataset. The input of the program is training set and unseen testing set. All feature values are continuous real values. Thus, uses a Gaussian distribution assumption. For continuous probability distribution functions, we canâ€™t exactly compute a probability value on a certain point because the probability is only defined in a certain range. However, it is fine to compare the probability density values to see which one is more probable. In the end, the accuracy of the model on training as well as testing set was computed.
