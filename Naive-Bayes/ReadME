Implemented Naive Bayes algorithm. The inputs of your script are training data and unseen data (testing data). The script needs to output the accuracy on both training and testing data. As you see, all feature values are continuous real values. Thus, we are going to use a Gaussian distribution assumption. For continuous probability distribution functions, we canâ€™t exactly compute a probability value on a certain point because the probability is only defined in a certain range. However, it is fine to compare the probability density values to see which one is more probable. Note that a value greater than 1 is fine here because it is a probability density rather than a probability. Please provide training accuracy and testing accuracy.
