Today, the modern home integrates many conveniences of technology. Technology -based home security and automation have become commonplace. Tasks such as locking doors, turning on/off lights, and controlling air conditioning can now be done remotely. Here we are using an Android enabled mobile phone as our main user client system in which we are using Android â€“java language for building the application. The phone uses the integrated Bluetooth system to pair itself with the Bluetooth of the microcontroller (using embedded systemprogramming) which in turn is connected with the digital door-lock system including to any other possible electronic appliances or gazettes.
Whenever the mobile phone comes within a predefined range of the Door-lock attached with the microcontroller, it automatically pairs itself with the Bluetooth of the microcontroller and introduces a password acceptance GUI in the mobile screen for authentication. If authenticated with the correct predefined password, then the user is prized with the unlocking of the door. If there is a an attempt of illegal entry for more than a predefined attempts then the door seizes to open and a notification can be sent to predefined phone numbers including the no of the owner as well as to social security services.
