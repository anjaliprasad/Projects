Implemented kNN algorithm.  An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. The inputs of the script are training data and unseen data (testing data). The script outputs the accuracy on both training and testing data. The program outputs accuracy results when k = 1,3,5,7 and (L1, L2) distances, respectively. Used leave on out strategy.
