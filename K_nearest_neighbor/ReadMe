Implemented kNN. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. The inputs of your script are training data and unseen data (testing data). The script needs to output the accuracy
ï¿¼on both training and testing data. You should provide accuracy results when k = 1,3,5,7 and (L1, L2) distances, respectively. Note that you should check if the nearest neighbor of a testing sample is itself. If so, it will give you 100% accuracy when k = 1. When computing the training accuracy of kNN, we use leave-one-out strategy, i.e. classifying each training point using the remaining training points.
